# Android-Slider-Puzzle

About the application:
It's a really simple android Puzzle game application. When you open the application, you can see 4x4 grid with random images. So the specification of application is:

1. Create 4*4 sliding puzzle
2. Click or tap on a tile should slide the tile to open space
3. Clicking or tapping on tiles that don't have legal move shouldn't respond anything
4. Application should support dragging the tiles
5. Dragging the tiles should smoothly move tile to correct space
6. If the drag/move is over halfway to complete, the move should complete
7. If the drag/move is less than halfway, tile should revert to the original position. 
8. Should count and display the total number of move
9. Implement a button or option to view original image. 

The current application is all functional and works perfectly. There are still lots of improvements I want to bring in, like
1. Better User interface
2. User being able to select custom image
3. Drag multiple tiles
4. Sync users progress record with web service
5. Implement immutable state architecture to manage the state of application
